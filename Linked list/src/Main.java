        /*------------------Why Linked List-------------------
        * 1.Limitations of array
        * The size of array is fixed . we should know the upper limit
        * Memory allocation is on upper limit of array irrespective of usage
        *  Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive
        * because the room has to be created for the new elements and to
        * create room existing elements have to be shifted.
        * -----------------------------------------------------
        * Advantages of linked list over array
        *  1.Dynamic
        *  2.Insertion and deletion is not expensive
        * -----------------------------------------------------
        * Drawback
        * 1,inserting at any position directly not done , we need to traverse and then insert
        * 2.Extra memory will bw allocated for pointers
        * 3.It does not have contigious memory
        * -----------------------------------------------------
        *  The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.
        * Node contains data and address/link
        * */
